# osv-wrapper
Wrap API calls to the OSV database for redundancy in case of missing data

A simple class project I was encouraged to push out in case anyone finds it useful. You can use it in your Go projects with:

```
osvwrapper.OSVQuery(pkgurl)
```

And you'll get back a string with the database output!
